# ForkBase Documentations #

This is an unofficial repository of ForkBase documentations. Documentations hosted in this repository are in draft status. Once the ForkBase source code is released as either an open source project or a permissioned software, contents contained in this repository will be integrated into the official ForkBase documentations. 

Please refer to [this post](https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/06/01/forkbase-an-efficient-storage-engine-for-blockchain-and-forkable-applications/) or our [research paper](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1137-wang.pdf) to look into the technology behind ForkBase.
